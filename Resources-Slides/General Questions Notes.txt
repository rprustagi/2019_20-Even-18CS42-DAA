Question for Back of the envelope calculations
. How long it will take to walk to Yellachennahalli metro station.
. What is the cost per hour you are paying for studying t KSIT?
. How long does it to take the fill the seminar hall?
. How much money you spent eating outside (your home) in last one year?
. An Uber driver claims that he has driven 100,000KM in last one year.

Important algorithm design techniques
  . Dynamic programming: save state
  . Preprocess information into appropriate data structures.
  . Divide and conquer approach: Split the problem into sub problems
  . Scanning algorithms: when working with arrays, how to extent the solution of x[0..i-1] to x[0..i]
  . Cumulative analytics: e.g. to compute the avg of 50 students, when 1 person is replaced.
  . Identify a matching lower bound.

Dynamic programming:
  . save state to avoid recomputation
    By using space to store results, we avoid time to compute

Iteration and Recursion: Complexity analysis
  Iteration
    Focus is on loops
    1. Finding Max or min in an unsorted array. O(n)
    2. Check if all elements in the array are distinct. O(n^2)
    3. Matrix multiplication. O(n^3)
    4. Number of bits in binary representation of n. O(log n)
  Recursion
    Write and solve recursion equation
    1. Tower of Hanoi
    2.
    3.
    4.
